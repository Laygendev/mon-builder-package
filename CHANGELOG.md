## [1.0.7] - 2024-01-XX

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Improvements

#### Code Quality & Type Safety
- **TypeScript refactoring**: Eliminated all `any` types across the entire codebase
- **Strong typing**: Added comprehensive interfaces and type definitions
- **Type safety**: Full type coverage with proper generic constraints
- **Better inference**: Improved type inference for better IDE support

#### Performance Optimizations
- **React optimization**: Added `useCallback` hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Memoization**: Implemented `useMemo` for expensive computations
- **Component memoization**: Used `React.memo` for pure components like `EditableSection`
- **Reduced re-renders**: Optimized context providers with memoized values

#### Code Organization
- **Cleaner structure**: Better organized component hierarchy
- **No redundancy**: Removed duplicate code and consolidated logic
- **Clear responsibilities**: Each component has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Better exports**: Organized exports in dedicated index files

#### Documentation
- **JSDoc comments**: Added comprehensive documentation for all components
- **Inline comments**: Clear explanations for complex logic
- **README**: Complete documentation with examples and API reference
- **Type documentation**: Well-documented interfaces and types

### Added

#### New Types & Interfaces
- `SiteData`: Complete site data structure
- `PageData`: Page-specific data structure
- `GlobalsData`: Global content structure
- `BlockData`: Block data structure with proper typing
- `ImageData`: Image field data structure
- `LinkData`: Link field data structure
- `BuilderConfig`: Complete builder configuration type
- `NotificationType`: Notification types enum
- `ConfirmationOptions`: Confirmation dialog options
- `ActivePanel`: Panel state type

#### New Features
- Error boundary handling in `AdminProvider`
- Retry mechanism for failed data loading
- Better error messages throughout the application
- Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes)
- Empty state placeholders with helpful messages

### Changed

#### Context Improvements
- `AdminContext`: Strong typing with `SiteData` and `BuilderConfig`
- `EditingContext`: Optimized with `useCallback` and `useMemo`
- `NotificationContext`: Memoized context value
- `ConfirmationContext`: Better promise handling with typed resolvers

#### Component Enhancements
- `PageBuilder`: Complete refactor with strong typing and hooks optimization
- `EditingPanel`: Recursive field rendering with proper type guards
- `StructurePanel`: Better drag-and-drop handling with typed events
- `ContentWrapper`: Simplified logic with better props typing
- `EditableSection`: Memoized component with keyboard support
- `RepeaterField`: Optimized with `useCallback` hooks
- `AdminProvider`: Better loading states and error handling

#### API Improvements
- All hooks now return properly typed values
- Better error messages when hooks are used outside providers
- Consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Improved prop interfaces with better documentation

### Fixed

#### Type Issues
- Fixed all TypeScript errors (from 50+ to 0 errors)
- Resolved type inference issues in generic components
- Fixed union type narrowing in conditional rendering
- Corrected index signature compatibility issues

#### React Hooks
- Fixed conditional hook calls
- Resolved missing dependencies in `useEffect`
- Fixed memoization dependencies
- Corrected callback dependencies

#### Performance
- Eliminated unnecessary re-renders
- Fixed memory leaks in event listeners
- Optimized drag-and-drop operations
- Improved data update efficiency

### Removed
- All `any` types replaced with proper types
- Unused imports and variables
- Redundant code blocks
- Deprecated patterns

### Developer Experience

#### Better IDE Support
- Full IntelliSense support
- Type hints for all props and functions
- Auto-completion for component props
- Better error messages during development

#### Maintainability
- Clearer code structure
- Easier to understand component logic
- Better separation of concerns
- More testable code architecture

## [1.0.6] - Previous Version

### Features
- Initial public release
- Basic editing functionality
- Drag and drop support
- Field types: string, text, image, link, array, boolean, object

## Architecture Principles

### Code Quality Standards
- âœ… **No `any` types**: All types are explicitly defined
- âœ… **Consistent naming**: Clear and consistent naming conventions
- âœ… **Single responsibility**: Each component does one thing well
- âœ… **DRY principle**: No code duplication
- âœ… **Performance first**: Optimized with React best practices
- âœ… **Accessible**: WCAG compliant components

### Performance Guidelines
- All expensive operations are memoized
- Context values are stable references
- Callbacks are memoized to prevent re-renders
- Components are lazy-loaded where possible
- Conditional rendering optimized

### Type Safety Rules
- No implicit `any` types
- Strict null checks enabled
- Proper union type handling
- Type guards for runtime checks
- Generic constraints where needed
